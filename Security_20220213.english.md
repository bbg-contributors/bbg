Who will be affected：Users of BBG v20220212 and before versions, with comment function enabled.

How to solve：Update to BBG 20220213 and republish your website.

How did this happen:

BBG v20220212 and before versions use Valine@1.4.14 when generating a site, however Valine@1.4.14 has an XSS security problem and may cause your website to be attacked.

Valine upstream published their patched verson 1.4.16 to fix the problem. From BBG v20220213, the site to be generated by BBG will use Valine@1.4.16 which has solved the XSS problem. We recommend all users of BBG to update to BBG v20220213 as soon as possible.
